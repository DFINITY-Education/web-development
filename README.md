# About

In this course, students will learn how to develop web applications on the IC and ultimately implement an open auction platform similar to eBay. Module 1 serves as an intro to this unit, providing a primer for web development by reviewing canister messaging, HTTP requests, cycles, and autonomous canisters. Module 2 introduces students to the idea of an open auction platform and completes the majority of the backend required for such a project. In Module 3, students connect their backend code with a frontend accessible via browser. Finally, Module 4 has students implement an autonomous governance canister, that acts as the decentralized arbiter of our auction platform's feature upgrades. 

## Getting Started

Welcome to your new web_development project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with web_development, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd web_development/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```
