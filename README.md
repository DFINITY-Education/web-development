# About

In this course, students will learn how to develop web applications on the IC and ultimately implement an open auction platform similar to eBay. Module 1 serves as an intro to this unit, providing a primer for web development by reviewing canister messaging, HTTP requests, cycles, and autonomous canisters. Module 2 introduces students to the idea of an open auction platform and completes the majority of the backend required for such a project. In Module 3, students connect their backend code with a frontend accessible via browser. Finally, Module 4 has students implement an autonomous governance canister, that acts as the decentralized arbiter of our auction platform's feature upgrades.
